## Biology

Hi, I have received my master's degree from Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences in July 2021, focusing on **semantic text matching**.



hahahhhahahahah

## Research Experience

* **Knowledge Enhanced Semantic Text Matching** &emsp;Jul 2020 - May 2021  
> **Abstract**: To improve the accuracy of the information retrieval system, this work focuses on how to match two texts with different lengths. Considering that short text lacks information when matching with long text, I propose a method that enhances the representation of short text with commonsense knowledge. Experimental results show that my method achieves up to **94.8%** f1-score in different long-short text matching datasets.   

* **Online News Topic Detection** &emsp;Mar 2020 - Jul 2020  
> **Abstract**: To accurately and quickly discover the latest news topic, I implemented an online detection system based on the single-pass algorithm. In addition, text representation is obtained by BERT, which is the state-of-the-art word embedding method. After being deployed, our system can handle **300 texts** per minute and stably operate in long term.  

* **Hot Topic Mining in Weibo** &emsp;Oct 2019 - Jan 2020  
> **Abstract**: To discover users' interest in social media, this work focuses on mining hot topics from a large number of Weibo texts. When involved in this project, I reproduce the LDA model and design a heat calculation formula. By introducing different weights into the formula, the rankings of different topics become more reasonable.  

* **Parallel Optimization of LTE Channel Estimation Algorithm Based on ARM NEON
Instruction Set** &emsp;Dec 2017 - May 2018  
>  **Abstract**: To reduce the cell search time when initializing the device, this work parallelly optimizes the LTE channel estimation with the ARM NEON instruction set. During my participation, I designed and implemented the optimization schemes. The experimental results show that the execution efficiency of the searching algorithm is improved at least **25%** by applying the NEON instruction set.
